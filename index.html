   <font size="3"><span style="font-family:times new roman,serif">Robert (1905-1919[age 13]) , Margaret and William (1911-1925[age 14]). The elder, William, died in 1919 at age 13 from Endocarditis (inflamation of the heart).  Six years later in 1925 the younger son Robbie died from Tetanus (Lockjaw) which developed from a serious wound inflicted by the kick of a horse.  By 1925, both of Alex's sons had died slow, painful deaths in their early teenage years.  Needless to say, this was very hard on Huston, his wife and his surviving daughter Margaret who lost both of her brothers.  Margaret lived into her eighties and had two children, both of whom are still living in Ontario and have families of their own.
